# nf-core/createtaxdb: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution
- [Bracken](#bracken) - Database files for Brakcen
- [Centrifuge](#centrifuge) - Database files for Centrifuge
- [DIAMOND](#diamond) - Database files for DIAMOND
- [Kaiju](#kaiju) - Database files for Kaiju
- [Kraken2](#kraken2) - Database files for Kraken2
- [KrakenUniq](#krakenuniq) - Database files for KrakenUniq
- [MALT](#malt) - Database files for MALT

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

### Bracken

[Bracken](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken/)(Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a highly accurate statistical method that computes the abundance of species in DNA sequences from a metagenomics sample.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `bracken/`
  - `<db_name>/`
    - `database100mers.kmer_distrib`: Bracken kmer distribution file
    - `database100mers.kraken`: Bracken index file
    - `database.kraken`: Bracken database file
    - `hash.k2d`: Kraken2 hash database file
    - `opts.k2d`: Kraken2 opts database file
    - `taxo.k2d`: Kraken2 taxo database file

    - `taxonomy/`: Intermediate Kraken2 directory containing taxonomy files of added genomes
    - `seqid2taxid.map`: Intermediate Kraken2 file containing taxonomy files of added genomes

</details>

Note that all intermediate files are required for Bracken2 database, even if Kraken2 itself only requires the `*.k2d` files.

The resulting `<db_name>/` directory can be given to Bracken itself with `bracken -d <your_database_name>` etc.

### Centrifuge

[Centrifuge](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) is a very rapid and memory-efficient system for the classification of DNA sequences from microbial samples.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `diamond/`
  - `<database>.*.cf`: Centrifuge database files

</details>

A directory and `cf` files can be given to the Centrifuge command with `centrifuge -x /<path>/<to>/<cf_files_basename>` etc.

### Diamond

[DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) is a accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner particularly used for protein alignment.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `diamond/`
  - `<database>.dmnd`: DIAMOND dmnd database file

</details>

The `dmnd` file can be given to one of the DIAMOND alignment commands with `diamond blast<x/p> -d <your_database>.dmnd` etc.

### Kaiju

[Kaiju](https://bioinformatics-centre.github.io/kaiju/) is a fast and sensitive taxonomic classification for metagenomics utilising nucletoide to protein translations.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `kaiju/`
  - `<database_name>.fmi`: Kaiju FMI index file

</details>

The `fmi` file can be given to Kaiju itself with `kaiju -f <your_database>.fmi` etc.

### Kraken2

[Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) is a taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast classification speeds.
